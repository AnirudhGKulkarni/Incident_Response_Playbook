# Incident Response Playbook

## Project Description
This project focuses on designing a structured Incident Response Playbook to help organizations detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents efficiently. The playbook provides step-by-step response procedures for common cyber threats.

---

## Project Objective
- Understand Incident Response processes  
- Create a structured Incident Response Playbook  
- Define roles and responsibilities during incidents  
- Develop response procedures for common attacks  

---

## Scope of the Project
This project focuses on documentation and procedural design of Incident Response strategies. It does not include automation or tool integration and is designed to demonstrate theoretical and practical understanding of incident handling.

---

## Incident Scenarios Covered
- Phishing Attack  
- Malware Infection  
- Unauthorized Access  

---

## Incident Response Lifecycle Used
This project follows the standard Incident Response lifecycle:

- Preparation  
- Identification  
- Containment  
- Eradication  
- Recovery  
- Lessons Learned  

---

## Tools and Technologies (Conceptual Usage)
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)  
- Endpoint Security Solutions  
- Antivirus Systems  
- Firewalls  
- Threat Intelligence Platforms
